# TO-DO

* Fix the checkWin Function: When the player wins, the game doesn't show the Win Container. 
* FiX Hints: I want Easy mode to have 2 hints. Medium 1 hint. Hard 0 hints.
* Fix tile reveal: When the player presses a tile for the first time, it should make a small "explosion" to show an area of the map. That explosion should't be too big nor too small.
