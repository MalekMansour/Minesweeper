# Minesweeper

Welcome to Minesweeper! The goal is to clear all the cells without detonating any mines.
      - Tap on a cell to reveal what's underneath.
      - Numbers show how many mines are adjacent to that cell.
      - Long press to flag a cell if you think there's a mine.
      Clear the board to win. Good luck!
