# Minesweeper

## Welcome to Minesweeper! The goal is to clear all the cells without detonating any mines.
      1. Tap on a cell to reveal what's underneath.
      2. Numbers show how many mines are adjacent to that cell.
      3. Use the flag on a cell if you think there's a mine.
      Clear the board to win. Good luck!
